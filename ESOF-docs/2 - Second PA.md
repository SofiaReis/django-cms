Django CMS - Requirements Elicitation
===================

 

Issues
-------

Django-CMS by being open-source allows any outside contributor to post any issue they may find in the code or design and they are not limited to errors and bugs but can also suggest any kind of performance improvement.

> Raising an issue
-------

In order to raise an issue Django's documentation wants firstly to raise awareness for **not posting any security issue** publicly (through IRC, GitHub, nor e-mail addresses, or any other forum or chat, etc) and they have specifically added an e-mail (security@django-cms.org) to post any security issue.

All other issues can me submitted through the other referred means and we will be focusing mainly on submitting the issue through GitHub.

> How to efficiently construct an issue report
=======

In order to maximize time efficiency through clarity a report should contain a clear,succinct and informative title, for example
> “show_sub_menu displays incorrect nodes when used with soft_root” is helpful, whereas “Menus are broken” is not.

In report's description it should be included

>- How to reproduce the problem.
>- What you expected to happen.
>- What did happen (a traceback is often helpful, if you get one).

> Getting your issue accepted
=======

If we browse through GitHub's issues submission history we can observe that many of the issues have labels as seen on the end of each submission title in the image below.
