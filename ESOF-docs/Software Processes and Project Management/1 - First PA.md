1. Django CMS - Overview
===================

[Django CMS](http://www.django-cms.org/) is a web publishing plataform built with the web application framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). It offers support for developers to create and manage a site that fulfills their precise needs. Also, it's an open-source project, backed at [DIVIO](http://www.divio.com/) (a company that works mainly with Django and Phyton, also open-source technologies) and it has a large number of contributors from around the world.

Some of the main reasons why Django CMS is very popular over other Content Management Systems (CMS), is because it features:

> - robust internationalisation (i18n) support for creating multilingual sites;
> - virtually unlimited undo history, allowing editors to revert to a previous version;
> - front-end editing, providing rapid access to the content management interface;
> - support for a variety of editors with advanced text editing features;
> - a flexible plugins system that lets developers put powerful tools at the fingertips of editors, without overwhelming them with a difficult interface.

There are other benefits of using Django CMS, such as a very detailed documentation, flexible integration with existing projects and a large and active community that keeps Django CMS updated. For instance in September, Django CMS had 7 updates. 

Django CMS it's already used by some companies and universities like [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), [Salt.](https://www.salt.ch/en/), [L'Oreal](https://www.menexpert.de/), [CANONICAL](http://www.canonical.com/) and [Cardiff University](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/). 

Some curiosities, in statistic terms, about this platform:
> - it has been downloaded more than 50000 times;
> - it has almost 1500 forks on GitHub;
> - it has no more than 350 contributors, but has more than 3500 stargazers;
> - in the last 30 days, the Django CMS community has closed more than 100 issues; 
> - and, they are very active with commits on GitHub every month.

This is a platform with a high number of open-source contributions made by developers from all world which contributes towards a greater platform increase at efficiency and development. 

##2. Software Processes 

In terms of software engineering, DIVIO uses Agile as software development life cycle (also, known as software process). 
Agile is a group of software development methods in which solutions evolve through cross-functional teams. This teams have different functional expertises (technology, finance, marketing, human resources and others) working toward a common goal. Agile promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement and encourages rapid and flexible response.
In this group of software development methods named Agile, we can find a sub-method named Scrum that it's an iterative and incremental methodology for managing the development of the product and it's based on multiple small teams working in an intensive and interdependent manner. Scrum involves a project manager called the "scrum master" that is responsible for defining and prioritizing tasks to the developers complete and also responsible for planning sessions for each task. The master has daily and/or weekly meetings with the team to discuss how tasks are developing and to identify and evaluate potential project risks and fails. So, these meetings of evaluation can lead to constructive criticism and ideas for improvement.

DIVIO uses this methodology to manage and produce the project between DIVIO workers. But the wider development community, in other words, the majority of contributors on GitHub are "led by our [DIVIO's] example" as stated by DIVIO developers when contacted. These last contributors follow then the example given by the main contributors [inside DIVIO] and they contribute every day by trying to fix any issues that may come up on the code and other files available on GitHub. This is the main function of worldwide contributors on Django CMS.

Django CMS motivates the project followers to fork and participate in the improvement of the project and suggests that when the developer feels good enough about their code they should send a pull request to DIVIO team. Usually this code needs to have some unit tests and should have the features properly documented. By this, the project can always be improved and should never stagnate. The team refers also that the followers have the liberty to raise issues to the github page, and if the core developers accept this issue, the problem should be corrected.
