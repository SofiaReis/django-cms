5. Software Evolution
===================
We notice the main page of a djanco-CMS project has not an option to make login or something else. The user has to append ?edit to the URL and hit enter to be possible to acess login or other features. So, we decided to make a link and redirect this first page to the other, without append. Besides, we make another link to redirect to other administrator view. 

Here it's the link for the pull request made in Django-CMS: https://github.com/divio/django-cms/pull/4849.
