Django CMS - Overview
===================

[Django CMS](http://www.django-cms.org/) is a web publishing plataform built with the web application framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). It offers support for developers to create and manage a site that fulfills their precise needs. Also, it's an open-source project, backed at [DIVIO](http://www.divio.com/) (a company that works mainly with Django and Phyton, also open-source technologies) and it has a large number of contributors from around the world.

Some of the main reasons why Django CMS is very popular over other Content Management Systems (CMS), is because it features:

> - robust internationalisation (i18n) support for creating multilingual sites;
> - virtually unlimited undo history, allowing editors to revert to a previous version;
> - front-end editing, providing rapid access to the content management interface;
> - support for a variety of editors with advanced text editing features;
> - a flexible plugins system that lets developers put powerful tools at the fingertips of editors, without overwhelming them with a difficult interface.

There are other benefits of using Django CMS, such as a very detailed documentation, flexible integration with existing projects and a large and active community that keeps Django CMS updated. For instance in September, Django CMS had 7 updates. 

Django CMS it's already used by some companies and universities like [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), [Salt.](https://www.salt.ch/en/), [L'Oreal](https://www.menexpert.de/), [CANONICAL](http://www.canonical.com/) and [Cardiff University](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/). 

Some curiosities, in statisc terms, about this plataform:
> - it has been downloaded more than 50000 times;
> - it has almost 1500 forks on github;
> - it has no more than 350 contributers, but has more than 3500 stargazers;
> - in the last 30 days, the Django CMS community has closed more than 100 issues; 
> - and, they are very active with commits on github every month.

This is a plataform with a high numbers of open-source contributions by developers from all world. Fact that contributes for the plataform increasing at efficiency and development. 

##Software Processes 

In terms of software engineering, DIVIO uses Agile as software development life cycle (also, known as software process). 
Agile is a group of software development methods in wich solutions evolve through cross-functional teams. This teams has different functional expertise (technology, finance, marketing, human resources and others) working toward a common goal. Agile promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response.
In this group of software development methods named Agile, we can find Scrum that it's an iterative and incremental methodology for managing the development of the product and it's based on multiple small teams working in an intensive and interdependent manner. Scrum involves a project manager called the "scrum master" that is responsible for defining and prioritizing tasks to the developers complete and also responsible for planning sessions for each task. The master has daily or weekly meetings with the team to discuss how tasks are doing and to identify and evaluate potential project risks and fails. So, this meetings of evaluation can led to constrictice criticism and ideias for improvement.

DIVIO uses this methodology to manage and produce the product between the DIVIO workers. But the wider development community, in other words, the majority of contributers on github are led by DIVIO example. They do what they see the main workers doing and they contribute every day resolving the issues that are posted on github. This is the main function of contributors on Django CMS.
