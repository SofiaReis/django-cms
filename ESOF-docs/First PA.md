Django CMS - Overview
===================

[Django CMS](http://www.django-cms.org/) is a web publishing plataform built with the web application framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). It offers support for developers to create and manage a site that fulfills their precise needs. Also, it's an open-source project, backed at [DIVIO](http://www.divio.com/) (a company that works mainly with Django and Phyton, also open-source technologies) and it has a large number of contributors from around the world.

Some of the main reasons why Django CMS is very popular over other Content Management Systems (CMS), is because it features:

> - robust internationalisation (i18n) support for creating multilingual sites;
> - virtually unlimited undo history, allowing editors to revert to a previous version;
> - front-end editing, providing rapid access to the content management interface;
> - support for a variety of editors with advanced text editing features;
> - a flexible plugins system that lets developers put powerful tools at the fingertips of editors, without overwhelming them with a difficult interface.

There are other benefits of using Django CMS, such as a very detailed documentation, flexible integration with existing projects and a large and active community that keeps Django CMS updated. For instance in September, Django CMS had 7 updates. 

Django CMS it's already used by some companies and universities like [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), [Salt.](https://www.salt.ch/en/), [L'Oreal](https://www.menexpert.de/), [CANONICAL](http://www.canonical.com/) and [Cardiff University](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/).
