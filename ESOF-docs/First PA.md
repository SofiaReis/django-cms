Django CMS - Overview
===================

Django CMS is a web publishing plataform built with the web application framework Django. Django CMS offers support for developers to create and manage a site that fulfills their precise needs. 

Some of the main reasons why Django CMS is very popular over other Content Management Systems (CMS), is because it features:

> - robust internationalisation (i18n) support for creating multilingual sites;
> - virtually unlimited undo history, allowing editors to revert to a previous version;
> - front-end editing, providing rapid access to the content management interface;
> - support for a variety of editors with advanced text editing features;
> - a flexible plugins system that lets developers put powerful tools at the fingertips of editors, without overwhelming them with a difficult interface.

There are other benefits of using Django CMS, such as a very detailed documentation, flexible integration with existing projects and a large and active community that keeps Django CMS updated. For instance in September, Django CMS had 7 updates.
