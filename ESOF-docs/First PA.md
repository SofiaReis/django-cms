Django CMS - Overview
===================

[Django CMS](http://www.django-cms.org/) is a web publishing plataform built with the web application framework [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). It offers support for developers to create and manage a site that fulfills their precise needs. Also, it's an open-source project, backed at [DIVIO](http://www.divio.com/) (a company that works mainly with Django and Phyton, also open-source technologies) and it has a large number of contributors from around the world.

Some of the main reasons why Django CMS is very popular over other Content Management Systems (CMS), is because it features:

> - robust internationalisation (i18n) support for creating multilingual sites;
> - virtually unlimited undo history, allowing editors to revert to a previous version;
> - front-end editing, providing rapid access to the content management interface;
> - support for a variety of editors with advanced text editing features;
> - a flexible plugins system that lets developers put powerful tools at the fingertips of editors, without overwhelming them with a difficult interface.

There are other benefits of using Django CMS, such as a very detailed documentation, flexible integration with existing projects and a large and active community that keeps Django CMS updated. For instance in September, Django CMS had 7 updates. 

Django CMS it's already used by some companies and universities like [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), [Salt.](https://www.salt.ch/en/), [L'Oreal](https://www.menexpert.de/), [CANONICAL](http://www.canonical.com/) and [Cardiff University](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/). 

Some curiosities, in statisc terms, about this plataform are:
> - it has been downloaded more than 50000 times;
> - it has almost 1500 forks on github;
> - it has more than 300 contributers, but has more than 3500 stargazers;
> - in the last 30 days, the Django CMS community has closed more than 100 issues; 
> - and, they are very active with commits on github.

##Software Processes 

In terms of software engineering, Django CMS uses Agile as software development life cycle (also, known as software process). Agile is a group of software development methods in wich solutions evolve through cross-functional teams. 

It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

Scrum is an iterative and incremental Agile development methodology for managing the development of a product. The Scrum methodology is that a team works as a unit to reach a common goal


 It defines "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal", challenges assumptions of the "traditional, sequential approach" to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines in the project.

A key principle of scrum is its recognition that during production processes, the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called "requirements churn"), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, scrum adopts an empirical approachâ€”accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team's ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements.
